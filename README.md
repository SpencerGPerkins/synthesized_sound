# Synthesized Sound Mixtures

_This repo is preliminary work of mine into synthized signal generation, noise generation, and signal mixtures._

* audio_outputs : contains wav files of the synthesized mixtures as well as outputs from a simple wavetable synthesizer
* figures : contains spectrogram representations of the synthesized mixture outputs
* modules : contains the necessary modules for generating the waves, padding the individual waves for the mixtures, and some basic audio utilities.
* notebooks : contains the initial experimentation done in a Jupyter Notebook
* scripts : contains the primary script for generating the synthesized mixtures and a script for the wavetable synthesizer
